        <p>Ganges, dawn, a luminous haze<br>
            over the water. The bathing ghats<br>
            are busy with the faithful. (But India<br>
            is inconceivable without faith.)<br>
            The robed bathers, raising river water<br>
            to the sun, pouring it back<br>
            to mother Ganges, are they worshipping<br>
            the sun or the river?<br>
            For them God is everywhere<br>
            and everything.  Water, sun,<br>
            the river and the twinkling lamps floating on it<br>
            are part of one consciousness.<br><br></p>

        <p>The burning ghats too (such quantities of wood<br>
            stacked ready) are beginning their day.<br>
            The funeral party approaching in respectful haste<br>
            have a job to do. They build their pile,<br>
            move the body to the wood,<br>
            start the fire. I watch, but not for long.<br>
            This moment, so intimate, so public, reminds me<br>
            I am an intruder here. The ashes<br>
            will return to Ganga unwitnessed by me.<br><br></p>

        <p>Away from the river, the vendors of tea<br>
            do their trade among the stalls. Monkeys,<br>
            cheerfully pilfering, are chased away<br>
            half-heartedly, for they are Hanuman’s representatives,<br>
            and they, with the sacred, garbage-clearing cows,<br>
            are part of the one consciousness. In this land<br>
            all are “the faithful”, everything is God’s creation.<br>
            In this poverty is richness.<br><br></p>
