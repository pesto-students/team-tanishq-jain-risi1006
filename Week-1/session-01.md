# 1. Protocol Stack 
   Protocol Stack is combination of different layers that are used to enable communication between different layers of software or hardware in a networked system. It defines a standardized framework for transmitting and receiving data over a network.


As far as web technology is concered, 
We have following layers

## Application Layer : 
  This layer contains protocol which directly interacts with application. Like HTTP/ HTTPS, FTP, SMTP

## Transport Layer : 
  It is used to breakdown the data packets into more chunks so that there is no speed constraints.

## Network Layer : 
  It is helpful when we need to connect computers at diff network. We have IP address, ARP which is used to send the data packets at the right destination

## Physical Layer : 
  It's a transmission medium that helps to transmit data packets from one position to the other. It is useful because we have no medium constraint like we can accesss the computers only with physical medium.





# 2. Server : 
   It provides various functionalities, often called services such as sharing data or resources among multiple clients, or performing computation for client. 


Followings are the types of Server : 

## Application servers :  
   Application server is a server which is used to host the application.
## Mail Servers: 
   Mail server is server that handles and delivers email over a network, usually over the internet. It receives email from client computers and deliver them to other mail server. It also delivers email to client computers.

## FTP Servers: 
   FTP server is used for transferring files supporting sub directories, log in and set of manipulation commands.

## Proxy Servers: 
   Proxy server is a server application that acts as an intermediary for request from clients seeking resources from servers that provide those resources. 





# 3. Web hosting : 
  It is a service that allows individuals and organizations to make their websites accessible on the internet. When you create a website, you need to store its files and data on a server so that users can access it anytime from anywhere.

There are several types of hosting services available, each with its own features, advantages, and costs. Here are some of the most common types of web hosting:

## Shared Hosting: 
  In shared hosting, multiple websites are hosted on a single server. It is an affordable option as the server resources are shared among multiple users. However, since resources are shared, the performance may be affected if other websites on the server experience high traffic.

## VPS Hosting (Virtual Private Server): 
  VPS hosting involves dividing a physical server into multiple virtual servers, giving each website its dedicated resources. It offers better performance and scalability compared to shared hosting. Users have more control over their server environment and can install software and customize settings.

## Dedicated Hosting: 
  Dedicated hosting provides an entire physical server dedicated to a single website. This option offers the highest level of performance, customization, and security. Users have full control over the server and can choose hardware specifications. It is typically more expensive than shared or VPS hosting.

## Cloud Hosting: 
   Cloud hosting uses multiple servers interconnected in a network to host websites. It offers high scalability, reliability, and flexibility. Cloud hosting can handle traffic surges effectively by distributing the load across multiple servers. Users pay for the resources they consume, making it cost-effective for websites with varying traffic levels.




# 4. Scaling : 
  It refers to the ability of a web application or system to handle increased workload or accommodate growth in terms of users, traffic, or data volume. It involves adjusting resources to ensure that the application performs optimally even under high demand. Scaling is crucial for web applications because it helps maintain availability, performance, and user experience as the application's usage and requirements evolve.

## Vertical Scaling : 
  It also known as scaling up or scaling vertically, involves increasing the resources (such as CPU, RAM, or storage) of an individual server. It typically requires upgrading the server hardware or migrating to a more powerful server. Vertical scaling is suitable when the application's workload can be managed within a single server's capacity.

## Horizontal Scaling :
It also known as scaling out or scaling horizontally, involves adding more servers to distribute the workload. Instead of upgrading the existing server, horizontal scaling focuses on adding multiple servers and dividing the load among them. This approach allows for better scalability as the workload can be distributed across multiple servers, enabling improved performance and accommodating higher traffic volumes. Horizontal scaling requires load balancing mechanisms to evenly distribute requests among the servers. It provides better fault tolerance and can handle sudden traffic spikes more effectively.





# 5. SEO, or Search Engine Optimization :
  It refers to the practice of improving a website's visibility and ranking in search engine results pages.  It involves various techniques and strategies to make a website more search engine-friendly, ultimately driving organic traffic and increasing its online presence.

Here are some ways web developers can optimize their websites for better search engine rankings:

## On-Page Optimization: 
  Optimize individual web pages by ensuring they have unique and descriptive title tags, meta descriptions, and URLs. Use header tags (H1, H2, etc.) appropriately to structure the content. Include relevant keywords in the content, but avoid keyword stuffing.

## Quality Content: 
  Create high-quality, informative, and engaging content that provides value to users. Search engines prioritize content that is original, relevant, and well-written. Regularly update the website with fresh content to attract both users and search engine crawlers.

## Mobile-Friendly Design: 
  Ensure that the website is mobile-responsive and offers a seamless experience across different devices. Mobile-friendliness is a crucial ranking factor for search engines, considering the increasing number of mobile users.

## Page Speed Optimization: 
  Optimize the website's loading speed by compressing images, minifying CSS and JavaScript files, and utilizing caching techniques. A fast-loading website provides a better user experience and is favored by search engines.

## Image Optimization: 
  Optimize images by using descriptive alt tags and reducing file sizes without sacrificing quality. Properly optimized images improve page load times and provide alternative text for search engine crawlers.
