## Problem Statement:
Minimum Element in Min Heap

## Problem Statement:
Given a min heap, find the minimum element.


## Input Format:
The input will be an array representing the min heap.

## Output Format:
Output the minimum element.

## Test Case 1:
Sample Input: 
3,8,10,15,20

Sample Output:
3

## Test Case 2:
sample input: 
1,2,3,4,5

sample output:
1

## Level: Easy

## Hints:
- Remember that in a min heap, the minimum element is always at the root.
- The root of the min heap can be accessed directly using array indexing.

## Approach:
- To find the minimum element in a min heap, we simply return the value at the root of the heap (i.e., the first element of the array representation of the heap).
