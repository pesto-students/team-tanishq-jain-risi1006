/*

1. make a helper function which accept the index, 
2. make and api call to 2i+1 and 2i+2 as a left and right child of the tree
3. in base case, if the node is leaf node, return true. 
4. if child is greater than parent node then return true && prev ans else false

Time Complexity
1. we are iterating every element of the array hence TC - O(n)

Space Complexity : 
1. size of stack
